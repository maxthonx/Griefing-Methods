# Griefing Methods
These are the grieving methods I have been using for at least 3 years.
LustSQ and EuropeGrief methods => https://github.com/maxthonx/LustSQ-Methods-2023/

These are not viruses, Windows Defender flags spigotrce as a reverse shell because it is a dumping plugin with a reverse shell payload to use and, don't trust idiots like serlink or sysinvader.
